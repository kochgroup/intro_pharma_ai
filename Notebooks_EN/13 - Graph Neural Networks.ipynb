    "Graph Neural Networks are still a relatively new class of algorithms. Intuitively, molecules can be represented very easily as a (mathematical) graph. The bonds of a molecule correspond to the edges of the graph and the atoms to the nodes. <br> For computers, however, graphs are not as easy to read as, for example, a Smiles `string`. For graph neural networks we need at least two matrices to adequately represent moleculs. One is the adjacency matrix, which represents the connections between the atoms (i.e. the bonds). The other matrix is the feature matrix. This is where information about individual atoms can be stored.\n",

    "\n",
    "Again we can use the class `nn.Module` as a basis for our Graph Convolution. \n",
    "We start with the minimal framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class GraphConvolution(nn.Module):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to properly access the functions of the parent `nn.Module` class, we need to initialize it with `super().__init__()`. Of course, our convolutional layer needs to know how big the input is, and how big the output should be. \n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.in_featuers = in_features\n",

    "        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.FloatTensor(out_features))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can write the `forward()` function. Here the actual convolution happens, where the nodes with the features `x` are aggregated over their neighboring nodes using a matrix multiplication with the adjacency matrix `adj`. By including the learnable `weights` we can optimize the convolution during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def forward(self, x, adj):\n",

    "        output = torch.mm(adj, support)\n",
    "        return output + self.bias\n",

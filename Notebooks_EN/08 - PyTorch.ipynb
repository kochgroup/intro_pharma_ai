PyTorch, on the other hand, is mostly used in the scientific world. Basically, PyTorch is considered the easier framework to learn and is a bit more user-friendly overall. \n",

When you use momentum for training, the weights are not only updated according to the gradients of the current minibatch. The gradients of the previous minibatches also have an influence. The parameter `momentum` indicates how strong or weak the influence of the previous minibatches is.\n",
